# HTML5 Forms: markup and styling workshop

## Common info
Let's practice HTML and CSS knowledge. Please take your laptops. We'll try to make main markup and styling using mockup.

We'll create semantic HTML5 Form. We'll practice in creating logical and independent markup structure. We'll use and styling native HTML validation. We'll try to improve our approach to the template received from designer. Which questions to ask? How to satisfy designer and not to have headache in future. We'll try to find different solutions. We'll go step-by-step together.

Thank's [Kottans](https://github.com/kottans) for the [idea](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/test11.md).
